I used Unreal Engine Version: 4.7

The project as it stands does not have a fluid way of displaying my results but 
i shall explain how to obtain them.

To obtain results:
	1. Open the project.
	2. Navigate to the folder 'Content->Blueprints->Player'.
	3. In this folder select PlanePlayer.
	4. This is where i have all of my calculations.
	5. The Variable you need to change is 'GroundSpeed'.
	6. You can find this under the tabs 'Variables->Atmosphere'.
	7. I used Ground Speeds of '10, 100, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000' to gain my results.
	8. Next navigate to the 'Gold Comment Box' at the top of the 'Event Graph'.
	9. Here you can change the starting 'Altitude' and the type of 'Material' the object will use.
	10. Now go down the 'Event Graph', you will see two 'Green Comment Boxes', these control the speed of the object.
	11. Keep moving down the 'Event Graph' until you see a 'Blue Comment Box'.
	12. 'Double-Click' the node 'FindTotalTemperature', this is the node which contants the main calculations.
	13. This node contains the main logic for my results. Navigate to the right until you find an 'Orange Comment Box'.
	14. Add a 'Break Point' on this node.
	15. Now set the 'Ground Speed', Make sure you have the 'Altitude' and 'Material' you want.
	16. Finally select the 'Play' button.
	17. This will stop the code at the 'Break Point'. If you hover you mouse over the nodes to the left you will see there current values.

This is how I had to recieve my results. For every new result I would change the 'Altitude' and 'Material', 
Then change the 'GroundSpeed' for as many results I needed for that 'Altitude and 'Material' type.
Not the best method but the only thing i could do at the time.
